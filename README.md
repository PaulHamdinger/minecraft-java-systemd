# systemd files for Java Minecraft Server

## Goals

Show would it would take to run a Java Minecraft server on a home PC, behind a home router. With the extra goal of only bringing the server up when traffic is detected, and automatically shutting it down when there's no traffic anymore.

## Why?

There are a lot of fiddly bits to this setup. Hopefully someone can use it to help with their own systemd setup.
